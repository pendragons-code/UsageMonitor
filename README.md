# A basic Usage Reporter

Basically I made an internal api for a project that will send me messages on discord when the usage goes beyond a certain point. We also explored using other stuff such as notify-d for servers with a gui (although i advice against this). Last but not least, this is a temporary solution as we will be cutting off ssh and some other networking rules to test configurations, so port 80, the only unaffected port will be open to us to let us test our internal api.

# TLDR
personal project that has a lot of context, ignore this
